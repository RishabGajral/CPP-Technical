/*.  output
Base class
Derived class called
Derived Fun called

conclusion:

-->If you are calling fun() directly on a Derived object, there's no need for a virtual functionâ€”the correct function is called automatically.
-->Use virtual functions only when working with base class pointers or references and you need runtime polymorphism*/
